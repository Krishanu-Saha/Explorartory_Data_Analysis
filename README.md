**HOTEL BOOKING ANALYSIS**

**Introduction:**

The hotel industry heavily relies on understanding customer behavior and factors that influence booking decisions to improve revenue, reduce cancellations, and enhance customer satisfaction. This project analyzes hotel booking data from various perspectives to gain insights into customer behavior and the factors impacting their booking decisions. The dataset includes information about customers, hotels, and reservations, such as arrival and departure dates, number of guests, booking cancellations, and more. The project focuses on three main sections: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Cancellation Analysis, and Revenue Analysis.

**Objective:**

The objective of this project is to explore the hotel booking data and identify patterns and factors that influence customer booking decisions. By conducting EDA, cancellation analysis, and revenue analysis, the project aims to provide valuable insights for hotels to understand customer behavior, improve revenue generation, and reduce booking cancellations.

**Data Summary:**
The dataset consists of various features, including hotel type, booking cancellations, lead time, arrival dates, number of guests, meal type, country of origin, market segment, room types, booking changes, deposit type, and more. These features provide a comprehensive overview of the hotel booking data and serve as the basis for analysis in the project.

**Approach:**

The project starts with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where the dataset is analyzed to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and handle missing values. Key findings from the EDA include insights into guest demographics, length of stays, peak demand months, and booking trends.

The next section focuses on cancellation analysis, exploring the factors that influence booking cancellations. Variables such as waiting period, lead time, and room type mismatches are analyzed to determine their impact on booking cancellations.

The final section, revenue analysis, focuses on the Average Daily Rate (ADR) to understand revenue generation. The ADR is analyzed over time to identify patterns and peak revenue periods. The analysis validates the hypothesis that high demand during certain months contributes to higher ADR.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, this project successfully explores the hotel booking data and extracts meaningful insights. The analysis provides valuable information for hotels to make data-driven decisions. Recommendations include optimizing room availability for high-demand room types, adjusting ADR based on market demand, and improving customer service to reduce cancellations. The project highlights the importance of EDA in understanding data and drawing actionable conclusions. By leveraging the findings from this analysis, hotels can enhance revenue, improve customer satisfaction, and make informed business decisions
