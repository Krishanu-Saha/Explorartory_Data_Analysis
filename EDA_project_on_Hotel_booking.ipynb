        "The project analyzes the hotel booking data from different aspects to understand the customer behavior and the factors that affect their booking decision. The data set includes information about the customer, hotel, and the reservation such as the arrival and departure dates, the number of adults, children, and babies, the number of nights stayed, and whether the booking was canceled or not. The project was divided into three main sections: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Cancellation Analysis, and Revenue Analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the EDA section, the data was analyzed to understand the distribution of different variables and to identify the outliers and missing values. The findings showed that the majority of the bookings were made by single adults and couples without children, and the majority of the bookings were made for 2 to 4 nights. The data showed that the highest demand for hotel rooms was in July and August.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next section focused on the cancellation analysis, where the factors affecting the cancellation of bookings were explored. The results showed that the waiting period and the lead time had no significant effect on the cancellation of bookings. The analysis also showed that getting a different room than the one demanded did not result in the cancellation of the booking.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the revenue analysis section, the average daily rate (ADR) was analyzed to understand the revenue generated by the hotel. The results showed that the ADR rose from the beginning of the year to the middle of the year, reaching its peak in August and then lowering to the end of the year. The results confirmed the hypothesis that the high demand during July and August contributed to the high ADR.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the project was successful in exploring the hotel booking data and identifying the factors that affect the customer's booking decision. The findings of the project could be useful for hotels to understand the customer behavior and to make data-driven decisions to improve their revenue and reduce cancellations. The project also demonstrated the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis in understanding the data and drawing meaningful conclusions from it."

        "After conducting market analysis, it has been determined that Room Type A is the most in demand, however, Room Types H, G and F have higher Average Daily Rates (ADR). It is recommended that the number of rooms for Room Types H, G, and F be increased. The Resort Hotel generates slightly less revenue than the City Hotel, and thus, the Resort Hotel should slightly increase its ADR. The analysis also shows that guests at the Resort Hotel tend to either stay for a very short period or the entire week, while guests at the City Hotel stay for an average of 3 days. Additionally, the Resort Hotel tends to receive bookings slightly in advance compared to the City Hotel and has more repeat customers, indicating a higher level of customer satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the City Hotel has a higher average number of days on its waiting list and a higher cancellation rate of 30%. It is suggested that the City Hotel focus on improving its customer service to enhance guest satisfaction. The analysis reveals that approximately 50% of the guests come from PRT, GBR, and FRA. The ADR has a pattern of increasing from the start of the year, peaking in August, and declining towards the end of the year. However, there is still potential for hotels to secure high ADR deals towards the end of the year. The high demand during July and August contributes to the high ADR, thus confirming the hypothesis.\n",
